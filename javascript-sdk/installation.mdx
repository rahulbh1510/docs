The SDK connects your live product environment to the agents you've built in the Agent Builder—powering the Copilot experience for your end users.

You’ll learn how to choose the right integration method, where to place the code, and how to get the agent running in just a few steps.

## What You’ll Need Before You Start

- Access to your application’s codebase (or help from an engineer)
- Your organization license key, found in **Settings → SDK Configuration** inside the Adopt platform
- A staging or demo environment for safe testing (recommended)

## Step 1: Choose Your Integration Method

Adopt supports two integration methods:

| Method                         | Best For                                        | Notes                                                |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Script / CDN** (Recommended) | Simple setups, fast testing, or marketing sites | Auto-initializes the SDK. Minimal setup needed.      |
| **NPM Package**                | React/Vue/SPA apps with build tools             | Gives full control over lifecycle and configuration. |

## Step 2a: Script / CDN Setup

This is the easiest and fastest way to get started.

### 1. Add the Widget Container

Place this wherever you want the Copilot to appear:

```html
<div id="adopt-widget-container"></div>
```

### 2. Include the SDK Script

Replace `YOUR_ORG_LICENSE_KEY` with your actual license key:

```html expandable
<scriptsrc="<https://cdn.adopt.ai/sdk/core/copilot.js
"data-adopt-license-key="YOUR_ORG_LICENSE_KEY">
</script>
```

✅ This script automatically initializes the SDK with your org ID

✅ All methods will be available via the `window.AdoptAI` global object

### 3. Boot the Agent

Trigger the agent for the active user:

```html
<script>
  window.AdoptAI.boot('user-123', {
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  }, {
    products: ['sidebar', 'spotlight']
  });
</script>
```

---

## Step 2b: NPM Package Setup

Recommended for applications using modern frameworks or custom build pipelines.

### 1. Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @adoptai/sdk
```

### 2. Import and Initialize

```javascript
import { init, boot } from '@adoptai/sdk';

// First, initialize the SDK
init('your-org-license-key');

// Then, boot the agent
boot('user-123', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com'
}, {
  products: ['sidebar', 'spotlight']
});
```

<Info>
  \*\*Important - \*\* init() must be called before boot() when using the NPM package. If skipped, the agent will not load.
</Info>

## Finding Your License Key

Your license key is a unique ID that connects your app environment to Adopt’s backend.

You can find it in the **Adopt dashboard → Settings → SDK Configuration** tab.

Copy this into your script tag (`data-adopt-license-key`) or pass it to `init()` if using the NPM package.
