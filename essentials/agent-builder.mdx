**Agent Builder** is the core platform that your product and engineering teams will use to design, develop, deploy, and manage AI Agents inside your application.

It’s built for internal use by product and engineering teams—your end users will never see it.

The platform gives you full control over the agent lifecycle—from setup and action creation to testing, deployment, and debugging. It’s designed to simplify the process, so you can move fast without getting blocked by complex workflows or heavy engineering lift.

## What You Can Do with Agent Builder

Agent Builder supports the full agent development workflow, covering the following key use cases:

### **Review Tools \+ Actions**

Understand what Adopt has auto-discovered from your app—your APIs, content, pages, and entities—and see how they’ve been mapped into usable actions.

### **Build \+ Edit and Test Actions**

Create custom actions, fine-tune logic, and test performance—all through natural language or guided UI blocks. No code required.

### **Design \+ Deploy End User Experience**

Control how and where the Copilot appears in your product, customize the UI, and test interactions using the Prompt Playground and Chrome extension.

### **Review and Debug Agent Performance \+ Behaviour**

Use built-in analytics, real-time logs, and observability tools to track agent usage, spot issues, and continuously optimize performance.

Agent Builder is designed to make powerful AI agent workflows accessible to real product teams. You don’t need to be an AI expert or a backend engineer—just bring your product knowledge, and we’ll give you the platform to bring it to life.
