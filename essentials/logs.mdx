Before we dive in—**what exactly are Logs?**

In Adopt, Logs are a full record of every interaction your users have with the agent. From the initial natural language request to the backend API calls, everything is captured so you can understand, troubleshoot, and improve your agent's performance. They’re your window into how the agent is behaving in the real world—with real users.

## Debugging Agent Behaviour with Logs

Your agent should run flawlessly most of the time. But when something does go sideways (hey, even the best systems have occasional hiccups), the Action Logs have your back.

Adopt’s Logs give you a detailed record of every agent interaction across your user base.

### What you can do with Logs:

- **Filter logs by:**
  - **Action type**
  - **Status** (completed, errored, incomplete)
  - **Customer or Org ID**
  - **End User ID** (with PII masked)
- **Inspect tool failures**\
  See the full step-by-step execution: tools called, payloads passed, and any errors returned.
- **Understand agent behavior logic**\
  Trace how each action step executed, including conditions, branches, and final outcomes.
- **Analyze performance bottlenecks**\
  View latency for each step to identify slow responses or services.

### Common Debugging Scenarios:

- Action silently fails → Logs show a step error due to a bad API response.
- Agent behavior is inconsistent → Logs reveal misconfigured step logic.
- Customer reports delay → Logs help pinpoint which tool caused latency.

> Use Logs to quickly isolate issues, verify agent execution, and push targeted fixes with confidence.
