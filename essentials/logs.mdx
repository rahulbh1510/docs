Before we dive in—**what exactly are Logs?**

In Adopt, Logs are a full record of every interaction your users have with the agent. From the initial natural language request to the backend API calls, everything is captured so you can understand, troubleshoot, and improve your agent's performance.

They’re your window into how the agent is behaving in the real world—with real users.

Watch this video below for a complete walkthrough.

## Debugging Agent Behaviour with Logs

Your agent should run flawlessly most of the time. But when something does go sideways (hey, even the best systems have occasional hiccups), the Action Logs have your back.

Spot an action that's failing frequently? Drill into the logs, review actual user conversations, pinpoint where things went off track, then jump to the Action Details page to fix it.

**The debugging flow:**

1. Notice an issue in the metrics
2. Filter logs to find the problem actions
3. Review the actual user conversations
4. Identify the root cause
5. Edit the action logic
6. Test and republish

Quick diagnosis. Fast fixes. Full control.
