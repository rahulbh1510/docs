# Agent Builder

The Agent Builder is the central hub for creating, configuring, and managing your AI agents within the AdoptAI platform.

## Overview

The Agent Builder provides a comprehensive interface for designing intelligent agents that can perform specific tasks and interact with users effectively. It combines intuitive design tools with powerful configuration options to help you build sophisticated AI experiences.

## Key Features

### Visual Agent Design
- Drag-and-drop interface for building agent workflows
- Visual representation of agent logic and decision trees
- Real-time preview of agent behavior

### Configuration Management
- Centralized settings for agent behavior and responses
- Integration with external APIs and services
- Custom prompt engineering and response templates

### Testing and Validation
- Built-in testing environment for agent interactions
- Performance metrics and analytics
- A/B testing capabilities for different agent configurations

## Getting Started

1. **Create a New Agent**: Start by defining your agent's purpose and scope
2. **Configure Basic Settings**: Set up name, description, and initial parameters
3. **Design Workflows**: Use the visual builder to create interaction flows
4. **Add Integrations**: Connect to external services and data sources
5. **Test and Iterate**: Use the testing environment to refine your agent

## Best Practices

- Start with simple interactions and gradually add complexity
- Test frequently during development
- Use clear, specific prompts for better agent responses
- Monitor performance metrics to optimize agent behavior

## Next Steps

Once you've built your agent, you can move on to testing it in different scenarios and eventually deploying it to your end users.
