Adopt AI is built with enterprise-grade security in mind. This page explains how to safely deploy the SDK in environments that enforce **Content Security Policy (CSP)**, and how to properly apply **nonces** when needed.

If your application uses a CSP to restrict which scripts and styles can run, you’ll need to follow these steps to ensure the Adopt Copilot loads without triggering CSP violations.

## What is a CSP?

A **Content Security Policy (CSP)** is a security feature that prevents unauthorized scripts or styles from being injected into your application. It works by explicitly allowing (or blocking) resources based on source, path, or nonce.

Without proper CSP configuration, your browser may block the Adopt AI SDK from running.

## Supporting CSP with Adopt

Adopt supports two approaches for working with CSP-secured environments:

### Option 1: Script / CDN with Auto-Detected Nonce

If you're using the **Script/CDN** method, you can pass the nonce directly into the script tag via a `data-nonce` attribute. Adopt will automatically detect and use it.

Example →

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
  script-src 'self' 'nonce-abc123' https://*.adopt.ai;
  style-src 'self' 'nonce-abc123' https://*.adopt.ai;
  connect-src 'self' https://*.adopt.ai;
">

<scriptsrc="<https://cdn.adopt.ai/sdk/core/copilot.js>"
  data-adopt-license-key="YOUR_ORG_LICENSE_KEY"
  data-nonce="abc123">
</script>
```

<Note>
  **Note** - The SDK will automatically pick up and use the nonce to comply with your CSP.
</Note>

### Option 2: NPM Package with Manual Nonce

If you’re using the **NPM package**, you’ll need to pass the nonce explicitly when calling `init()`.

Example →

```javascript
import { init, boot } from '@adoptai/sdk';

init('your-license-key', {
  nonce: 'abc123' // Same value as used in your script tag
});

boot('user-123', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com'
}, {
  products: ['sidebar', 'spotlight']
});
```

<Info>
  Make sure the nonce matches the one declared in your CSP meta tag. Otherwise, the browser may still block execution.
</Info>

## Good to Know

- All Adopt-hosted resources (SDK, assets, etc.) are served over HTTPS from `https://*.adopt.ai`
- Adopt does not inject third-party scripts
- You only need to handle CSP/nonce setup if you already have CSP enabled on your app
