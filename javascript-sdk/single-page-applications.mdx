If your app is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)**—using frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular—Adopt AI is fully compatible.

This page covers how the SDK handles route changes, how to keep the agent active across views, and how to register your app’s router so the Copilot behaves as expected.

## Why This Matters

In SPAs, route changes happen without full page reloads. That means components like the Copilot might not automatically reappear when a user navigates to a new page—unless they’re re-injected manually.

The good news? **Adopt handles this for you.**

With a simple `addRouter()` setup, the SDK will detect route changes and keep everything running smoothly.

## How to Set Up SPA Routing

Use the `addRouter()` method to pass your app’s navigation handler to Adopt. This allows the Copilot to stay in sync with your routing system.

### React Example (using React Router)

### Script/CDN:

```javascript
const navigate = useNavigate();

window.AdoptAI.addRouter((newUrl) => {
  navigate(newUrl);
});
```

### NPM Package:

```javascript
import { addRouter } from '@adoptai/sdk';

const navigate = useNavigate();

addRouter((newUrl) => {
  navigate(newUrl);
});
```

### Vue Example

```javascript
addRouter((newUrl) => {
  router.push(newUrl);
});
```

### Angular Example

```javascript
addRouter((newUrl) => {
  this.router.navigateByUrl(newUrl);
});
```

### Custom Routing

If you’re using a custom framework or vanilla JS:

```javascript
addRouter((newUrl) => {
  window.history.pushState({}, '', newUrl);
  // Trigger your internal route handling
});
```

### Automatic Re-injection

Adopt automatically re-injects the Copilot components when a route change is detected. As long as the widget container (`<div id="adopt-widget-container"></div>`) persists across views, no additional setup is required.

## Good Practices

- Place the Copilot container outside of route-specific layouts (e.g. in a global wrapper)
- Always call `boot()` after login—even in SPAs
- Use `shutdown()` on logout to clean up
