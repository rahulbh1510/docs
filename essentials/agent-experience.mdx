## What is the Agent Experience?

Agent Experience is the **end-user layer** where your customers interact with the agents you’ve built in Adopt’s Agent Builder.

Think of it as your app’s **Copilot interface** — a smart, natural-language-driven surface where users can ask questions, trigger workflows, and get real outcomes without needing to click through menus or learn your product’s layout.

## Deployment Options

Adopt AI supports **three powerful ways** to bring this experience to life, depending on your app’s design preferences and engineering flexibility.

### 1. [SDK Deployment (Plug-and-Play UI)](/javascript-sdk/introduction)

Use the Adopt SDK to quickly embed a fully functional, styled Agent Experience inside your app.

You can choose from two modes:

\*\*Copilot Sidebar \*\*\
A persistent, collapsible assistant that sits across your app.

**Universal Search**\
A command-style search bar that lets users query, run actions, and get answers.

<Note>
  **Note** - The SDK is ideal if you want a fast, zero-design lift way to go live with agents.

### 2. API Wrapper Deployment

Use Adopt’s API wrappers to call the agent's logic from **anywhere inside your own frontend** — using your design system and UI components.

This is perfect if:

- You want deeper customization or visual control.
- You need to inject agent functionality contextually (e.g. inside modals, dashboards, walkthroughs).
- You have embedded analytics or product flows that need agentic augmentation.

> The agent's intelligence is fully exposed via API, so your developers can build rich, native-feeling experiences.

### 3. MCP Server Deployment

If you want to host your product's agent on **third-party chat clients**, Adopt also offers a deeply configurable **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server.

You’ll still get all the functionality of the Adopt platform — including agent actions, observability, analytics, and tooling — while letting users interact with your agent _wherever they are_. It's the easiest way to meet your users where they already live.
