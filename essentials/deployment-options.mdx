Adopt AI supports **three powerful ways** to bring this experience to life, depending on your app’s design preferences and engineering flexibility.

### 1. SDK Deployment (Plug-and-Play UI)

Use the Adopt SDK to quickly embed a fully functional, styled Agent Experience inside your app.

You can choose from two key components:

- **Copilot Sidebar**\
  A persistent, collapsible assistant that sits across your app.
- **Universal Search**\
  A command-style search bar that lets users query, run actions, and get answers.

> The SDK is ideal if you want a fast, zero-design lift way to go live with agents.

### 2. API Wrapper Deployment

Use Adopt’s API wrappers to call the agent's logic from **anywhere inside your own frontend** — using your design system and UI components.

This is perfect if:

- You want deeper customization or visual control.
- You need to inject agent functionality contextually (e.g. inside modals, dashboards, walkthroughs).
- You have embedded analytics or product flows that need agentic augmentation.

> The agent's intelligence is fully exposed via API, so your developers can build rich, native-feeling experiences.

### 3. MCP Server Deployment

If you want to host your product's agent on **third-party chat clients**, Adopt also offers a deeply configurable **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server.

You’ll still get all the functionality of the Adopt platform — including agent actions, observability, analytics, and tooling — while letting users interact with your agent _wherever they are_. It's the easiest way to meet your users where they already live.
