## What is ZACTION?

ZACTION is Adopt’s proprietary system that transforms your discovered [**Tools**](/essentials/reviewing-tools)—including APIs, entities, and KB content—into interactive, executable agent programs called [**Actions.**](/essentials/reviewing-actions)

Think of Actions as the operational units your agent uses to get things done.

For example:

“Generate invoice,” “Update user permissions,” or “Get this week’s campaign performance.”

Each of these is an **Action**—and ZACTION is what builds them.

Actions are designed to be triggered via natural language, gather any required inputs from the user, and safely execute the corresponding API call. No manual wiring, no custom glue code.

## How It Works

ZACTION picks up where [ZAPI](/essentials/zero-shot-api-ingestion) leaves off.

Once your APIs, entities, and other resources have been discovered and structured inside the [**Tools Dashboard**](/essentials/reviewing-tools), ZACTION uses that foundation to automatically generate Actions.

Each Action contains:

- A **natural language trigger** (e.g., “Send renewal email to all customers in North America”)
- One or more **underlying APIs** to call
- A dynamic **input schema** to collect required user inputs
- A safe, testable **execution flow** with step-by-step instructions
- A **response formatter** to structure the output (tables, lists, summaries, etc.)

These Actions are visible and manageable inside the **Actions tab** of the Agent Builder.

You can:

- [Review or edit any action’s structure](/essentials/editing-actions)
- Add or adjust logic through instruction steps
- [Test actions with prompts before publishing](/essentials/testing-actions)

## Key Benefits of ZACTION

1. \*\*Zero manual effort - \*\*No need to write frontend code, design forms, or build integrations. Actions are fully generated.
2. \*\*Multiple variations per API - \*\*One API can generate multiple Actions, covering different intents and query styles.
3. \*\*Composable primitives - \*\*Actions can be reused, chained, or enhanced to create more advanced workflows.
4. \*\*LLM-ready execution - \*\*All Actions are formatted for natural language processing—so agents know when and how to use them.

## Why ZACTION Matters

Agentic applications need more than just API awareness—they need operational logic.

ZACTION fills that gap.

It turns the raw capabilities of your app into discrete, callable functions the agent can execute confidently.

You don’t just get a list of APIs—you get a library of intelligent, ready-to-run agent instructions.
