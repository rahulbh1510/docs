# Playground Profiles

Playground Profiles are pre-configured testing environments that allow you to test your AI agents under different conditions and scenarios. They provide a safe, controlled space to experiment with agent behavior before deploying to production.

## What Are Playground Profiles?

### Definition
Playground Profiles are customizable testing configurations that simulate different user environments, data conditions, and integration scenarios. They enable you to validate how your agents perform across various real-world situations.

### Key Benefits
- **Safe Testing**: Experiment without affecting production systems
- **Scenario Simulation**: Test different user personas and conditions
- **Rapid Iteration**: Quickly test changes and improvements
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Ensure agents work across all intended use cases
- **Team Collaboration**: Share testing scenarios with team members

## Profile Types

### User Persona Profiles
**Different User Types**
- **New Users**: First-time interactions with minimal context
- **Power Users**: Advanced users with complex requirements
- **Guest Users**: Limited access and capabilities
- **Admin Users**: Full access with elevated permissions

**Example Persona Configuration**
```json
{
  "profileName": "New Customer",
  "userType": "first_time",
  "context": {
    "hasAccount": false,
    "knowledgeLevel": "beginner",
    "preferredLanguage": "en",
    "deviceType": "mobile"
  },
  "limitations": {
    "maxConversationLength": 10,
    "accessToPersonalData": false,
    "availableActions": ["basic_info", "signup_help"]
  }
}
```

### Environment Profiles
**Different System Conditions**
- **Development**: Local testing with mock services
- **Staging**: Production-like with test data
- **Production Mirror**: Exact production replica
- **High Load**: Stress testing scenarios

### Data Profiles
**Various Data Scenarios**
- **Empty State**: No existing user data
- **Rich Data**: Comprehensive user history
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual or problematic data
- **Large Datasets**: Performance testing with volume

## Creating Playground Profiles

### Profile Setup Process
1. **Define Objectives**: What scenarios do you want to test?
2. **Choose Base Template**: Start with predefined or custom template
3. **Configure Parameters**: Set up user context and environment
4. **Add Test Data**: Include relevant datasets
5. **Define Success Criteria**: Establish what constitutes success
6. **Save and Share**: Make profile available to team

### Profile Configuration Options

- Track performance metrics

### Automated Testing with Profiles
**Test Script Integration**
```javascript
// Example automated test using profile
describe('Customer Support Agent', () => {
  const profile = loadPlaygroundProfile('returning_customer');
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    setupTestEnvironment(profile);
  });
  
  test('handles returning customer inquiry', async () => {
    const conversation = await startConversation(
      profile,
      'I need help with my recent order'
    );
    
    expect(conversation.agent.recognized).toBe('order_inquiry');
    expect(conversation.actions.triggered).toContain('order_lookup');
    expect(conversation.response.helpful).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### A/B Testing Scenarios
**Comparative Analysis**
- Test different agent configurations
- Compare response quality across profiles
- Measure user satisfaction metrics
- Optimize based on profile performance
