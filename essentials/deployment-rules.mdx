# Deployment Rules

Deployment Rules let you precisely control **where**, **when**, and **how** your AI Copilot appears in your product. Use them to target specific user segments, pages, or environments—so you can roll out new AI features safely and strategically.

## Why Use Deployment Rules?

- **Gradual rollouts:** Test new Copilot features with a subset of users before a full launch.
- **Environment targeting:** Restrict Copilot to staging or production environments.
- **User segmentation:** Show Copilot only to certain user roles, plans, or cohorts.
- **Page-level control:** Enable or disable Copilot on specific URLs or app sections.

## How Deployment Rules Work

Deployment Rules are managed in the Agent Builder UI under the **Deployment** tab. Each rule consists of:

- **Target**: Where the Copilot should (or should not) appear (e.g., URL patterns, environments).
- **Audience**: Which users see the Copilot (e.g., by role, plan, or custom attributes).
- **Conditions**: Additional logic (e.g., feature flags, rollout percentages).

You can stack multiple rules for fine-grained control. Rules are evaluated in order—first match wins.

## Example Scenarios

### 1. Roll Out to 10% of Users

Enable Copilot for a random 10% of your user base for A/B testing:
