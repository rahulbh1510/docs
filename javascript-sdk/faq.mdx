Have questions about how the Adopt AI SDK works? You’re not alone.

Below are answers to the most common questions from product and engineering teams during setup, integration, and deployment.

## General Usage

### Do I need to call `init()` every time a user visits my site?

- **Script**: No, the script auto-initializes.
- **NPM**: Yes, call `init()` once per page load, then call `boot()` when the user is ready.

### What’s the difference between Script and NPM integration?

- **Script**: Simple, auto-initialized, ideal for fast setup
- **NPM**: Gives you full control, TypeScript-ready, better for modern apps

### Can I use Adopt AI with multiple users on the same page?

No. Adopt is built for single-user sessions. You must call `shutdown()` before calling `boot()` for a different user.

### What happens if I call `boot()` before calling `init()` (NPM only)?

The SDK will throw an error. Always call and complete `init()` before `boot()`.

### Can I call `boot()` multiple times in a session?

Not recommended. Call it once per session. To change users, call `shutdown()` first, then `boot()` again.

### What happens if I call `boot()` before the widget container is rendered?

The agent may fail to load properly. Make sure `<div id="adopt-widget-container"></div>` is in the DOM before calling `boot()`.

### How do I completely remove the agent from the page?

Call `shutdown()`. This will unmount the agent UI and clean up the session.

### Does Adopt support anonymous or guest users?

No. A unique `userId` is required. For guests, generate a temporary UUID for the session.

## Integration & Environments

### Can I use different API base URLs for different environments (staging, prod, etc.)?

Yes. Set the `apiBaseUrl` in the `boot()` call to match your current environment.

### Is Adopt compatible with Next.js, Nuxt, or SSR frameworks?

Yes—with client-side precautions. Call SDK methods like `boot()` only in the browser (e.g. inside `useEffect()`).

### Does the SDK support iframe embedding?

We don’t currently recommend using Adopt in an iframe. Behavior may be limited or blocked due to sandboxing.

### Can I conditionally show different components (e.g. only Sidebar on some pages)?

Yes. You can dynamically configure the `products` array in your `boot()` call based on user or page context.

## Authentication & Security

### How do I handle auth token refreshes?

Use `setCopilotHeaders()` to update headers when your token refreshes.

**Script Example:**

```javascript
window.AdoptAI.setCopilotHeaders({
  Authorization: `Bearer ${newToken}`
});
```

**NPM Example:**

```javascript
import { setCopilotHeaders } from '@adoptai/sdk';

setCopilotHeaders({
  Authorization: `Bearer ${newToken}`
});
```

### Does Adopt AI support Content Security Policy (CSP)?

Yes. Adopt supports CSP nonces via `data-nonce` in script tags (for Script setup) or as a parameter in `init()` (for NPM).

## Customization & Targeting

### Can I customize the look and feel of the agent widget?

Yes. All theming is handled in the **Adopt dashboard → SDK Configuration** section. This includes colors, fonts, icon styles, and UI elements.

### Can I control which users see the agent experience?

Yes. Use **Targeting Rules** in your Adopt settings to define exactly which users should see the Copilot. If a user doesn’t match, the Copilot won’t load—even if `boot()` is called.

### How do I handle internationalization (i18n) in agent responses?

The agent will respond in the language your KB is written in. For advanced multilingual support, contact your Adopt representative to enable custom language behavior.

### Can I disable or hide specific actions for certain users?

Yes. You can configure action-level visibility from the **Action Builder** or through **Targeting Rules** set in your SDK configuration.
