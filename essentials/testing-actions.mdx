By this point, you’ve reviewed actions, created your own, edited steps, and explored the Action Details page. Now it’s time to put those actions to the test.

There are **two easy ways to test actions in Adopt**—depending on whether you want to validate the logic behind the scenes or see how the agent behaves inside your actual product.

## **Option 1: Test Inside the Agent Builder**

We’ve made this super simple.

Just head into the **Action Details page**, and look over to the **Test Action panel** on the right.

Here’s how it works:

- Type your **test prompt** into the chat - just like a real user would.
- Hit **enter**, and watch the agent go to work.

As the agent processes the prompt, you’ll see the **Instructions section** on the left light up step-by-step—each one showing a status badge and the time it took to complete.

Once all steps run, the agent’s response appears in the chat window—letting you verify:

- Which steps were executed
- How long the action took
- What the final output looked like

And if something breaks? No stress. You’ll know exactly **which step** failed. Just click into that step, edit the logic, and re-test until it’s good to go. It’s all live, transparent, and editable.

## **Option 2: Test in the Prompt Playground (On Your Product UI)**

If you want to see how an action behaves _inside your actual product_, just like an end user would experience it, the **Prompt Playground** is the way to go.

This flow lets you test any published action directly on your app’s interface - so you can validate not just the logic, but also the feel of the full agent experience.

Here’s how to do it:

1. **Start from the Action Details page**

   Navigate to the action you want to test, and click the `Test In-App` button at the top.
2. **Don’t have the Chrome extension yet? No problem.**

   If this is your first time, you’ll be prompted to download the [**Adopt AI Chrome Extension**.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adoptai-copilot/hknjdiahldmenfhmmdcbccpecnpneabk?authuser=0&hl=en) Just click the link in the pop-up and install it from the Chrome Web Store—it takes just a few seconds.

   />
3. **Input your Test URL**

   Once the extension is installed, you’ll be asked to enter the **Test URL -** this is usually your staging or demo environment where the agent is enabled.

   You can find this URL under **Playground Profiles** in your **Settings**.
4. **Experience the action in-app**

   After entering the URL, you’ll be redirected to your test environment. The agent will launch automatically, with your selected action already loaded into the prompt field. You’ll see the full Copilot interface right on top of your app, just like an end user would.

This is the fastest way to see how your agent behaves in the wild—what prompt is shown, how the UI flows, and how natural it feels in context.

<Note>
  **Note** - Even though you launched the Playground from a specific action, once you’re in, you can test any other published action by simply typing in a new prompt.

<Note>
  **Shortcut** - You can also open the Prompt Playground anytime by clicking the Adopt AI Chrome Extension icon from your toolbar—no need to go through the Agent Builder each time.
