# Logs

Logs provide a detailed record of your Copilot’s activity, making it easier to troubleshoot issues, monitor usage, and ensure everything is running smoothly.

## What Do Logs Include?

- **User Interactions:** Every question, command, or action initiated by users.
- **Copilot Responses:** The answers or actions taken by the Copilot in response to user input.
- **System Events:** Errors, warnings, and other system-level events.
- **Timestamps:** When each event occurred for accurate tracking.

## How to Access Logs

You can view logs in the [Adopt dashboard](https://adopt.ai) under the **Logs** or **Activity** section. Logs can be filtered by date, user, action, or event type to help you quickly find relevant information.

## Common Use Cases

- **Troubleshooting:** Identify and resolve issues by reviewing recent errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Auditing:** Track who did what and when for compliance or review purposes.
- **Usage Analysis:** See which features are being used most and how users interact with your Copilot.

## Exporting Logs

For advanced analysis, you can export logs as CSV or JSON files from the dashboard. This allows you to integrate with external analytics tools or keep records for auditing.

> **Tip:** Regularly review your logs to catch issues early and continuously improve your Copilot’s performance.
