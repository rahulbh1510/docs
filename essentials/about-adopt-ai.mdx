Welcome to our Docs. ☺️

If you've made it here, you probably know a bit about the massive shift happening in the world of software, what folks are calling the 'Agentic Era'.

If you don't, that's completely okay too - you're in the right place to learn everything you need to know.

Before we dive into the details of how you can meet your goals with Adopt AI, we'd like to take a quick second to introduce some core concepts that will help you understand our product much better.

Happy reading\!

## **What is Adopt AI?**

Adopt AI is a platform that enables enterprise software applications transform into powerful AI Agents within days.

Here's a bit more on what we mean →

Put simply - The era of users pointing and clicking through static GUIs to get work done is behind us. Today users want to use natural language to tell their applications what they need - and have the app understand their intent and execute the actions for them.

They want smart Agents that get work done, not static Systems of Record.

And we help applications make this leap by automatically enabling all their actions to be executed via natural language commands, transforming them into powerful AI Agents.

## **How does it (really) work?**

Here's where things get exciting.

Adopt AI is designed to make it super easy for an application to become agentic, with **zero engineering lift required to get started.**

We do this by automatically generating two key components: **Tools** and **Actions**.

- **Tools** are your application's building blocks - your API’s, entities, content, pages and settings that make your application tick.
- **Actions** are what your users actually want to accomplish—like "Add a new user" or "Get campaign statistics"—powered by those Tools working together seamlessly.

  While setup is effortless, your engineering team can still go deep - customizing, extending complex agent workflows and behavior as needed.

### **How we build Tools and Action automatically →**

Once we gain access to your demo account, we deploy intelligent AI agents that act like power users of your application. These agents systematically explore your interface—clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating workflows—essentially performing every action a real user might do.

While they’re busy exploring, we capture all the network files behind the scenes—automatically capturing and cataloging API’s and making them LLM Ready.

This automated API Discovery process is managed by our proprietary Zero-Shot API Ingestion system; aka [ZAPI.](/essentials/zero-shot-api-ingestion)

**Within 24 hours**, we've mapped your entire application's capability landscape — every Tool that makes your software tick.

Once we have your Tools discovered and organized, we use them to auto-generate the final Actions that power natural language interactions.

This is handled by our proprietary system [Zero Shot Action Generation](/essentials/zero-shot-action-generation) (ZACTION), which builds composable, testable actions designed for how users actually speak and work.

Now when your users say “Show me this month's campaign performance,” we know exactly which APIs to orchestrate behind the scenes to deliver that result instantly.

Phew, yes that was a lot to take in—but if you read it twice, you’ll see it’s actually quite simple.

## Who we’re for

Adopt AI is built for **any software application company** that's ready to adapt to the Agent era and revolutionize their end user experience.

Whether you're a fintech platform, healthcare solution, project management tool, or e-commerce system - if your users interact with software, we can help make those interactions conversational and intuitive.

### **The Teams We Empower →**

We specifically enable **Product** and **Engineering Teams** inside software companies to build and deploy agent experiences without the typical complexity:

- **Product Teams** get the power to design intelligent user interactions without getting bogged down in technical implementation.
- **Engineering Teams** can deliver sophisticated AI capabilities without months of custom development work.

The beauty of our approach? Both teams can collaborate seamlessly to create something that would traditionally require significant AI expertise, engineering resources and months of effort.

Think of us as your bridge to the Agent era - we handle the heavy lifting so your teams can focus on what they do best: building exceptional software experiences that your users will love.
