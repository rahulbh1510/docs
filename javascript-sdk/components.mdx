The Adopt AI SDK provides two main interface components that power the Copilot experience: **Sidebar** and **Spotlight**. You can enable either one—or both—depending on how you want users to interact with the agent inside your product.

This page walks you through what each component does, how to enable them, and how to combine them for a flexible agent experience.

### 1. **Sidebar**

A persistent, slide-out panel that lives on the edge of your app—ideal for deep interaction, guided assistance, or multitask workflows.

**Features:**

- Full-height side panel UI
- Rich inputs and outputs (e.g. forms, charts, tables)
- Always accessible during user sessions

**Enable via Script/CDN:**

```javascript
window.AdoptAI.boot('user-123', userProperties, {
  products: ['sidebar']
});
```

**Enable via NPM Package:**

```javascript
import { boot } from '@adoptai/sdk';

boot('user-123', userProperties, {
  products: ['sidebar']
});
```

### 2. **Spotlight**

A centered overlay for quick actions, focused prompts, or spotlight guidance. Ideal for search-like behavior or launching short agent flows.

**Features:**

- Appears as a floating prompt or modal
- Great for lightweight, one-step tasks or FAQs
- Can be triggered via hotkey, button, or UI element

**Enable via Script/CDN:**

```javascript
window.AdoptAI.boot('user-123', userProperties, {
  products: ['spotlight']
});
```

**Enable via NPM Package:**

```javascript
import { boot } from '@adoptai/sdk';

boot('user-123', userProperties, {
  products: ['spotlight']
});
```

### 3. **Using Both Together**

You can enable both Sidebar and Spotlight at the same time for a blended experience. For example: Spotlight for quick search, and Sidebar for full workflows.

**Combined Config (Script or NPM):**

```javascript
boot('user-123', userProperties, {
  products: ['sidebar', 'spotlight']
});
```

### Where to Customize UI Appearance

Theme and appearance settings (like colors, icons, and branding) are managed from your **Adopt dashboard → Settings → SDK Configuration**.

The SDK will automatically fetch and apply your theme settings at runtime—no need to hardcode styles.
