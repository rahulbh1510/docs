Now that your Tools (APIs, Entities, Pages, and Knowledge Base content) have been discovered and defined, it's time to see what they’ve helped create—**Actions**.

### What’s an Action?

An **Action** is a single, well-defined task that a user can perform inside your product—like _“Create a new campaign,”_ _“Update user access,”_ or _“Show me this month’s spend.”_

Actions are what power the Agent’s capabilities. They're how natural language inputs like “Cancel John’s license” get translated into structured API calls and real outcomes. In short, **Actions are what your agent can do.**

Every Action combines your tools—API endpoints, Pages, KB content—into a usable command the agent can understand and execute.

You can watch the video below for a complete walkthrough of the Actions section inside the Agent Builder platform, or keep reading for a step-by-step breakdown.

From the **Actions** tab inside the Agent Builder, you’ll see a full list of all the Actions Adopt has generated for your app.

Here's a quick overview of what each column represents →

| **Column**        | **What It Means**                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Action**        | The name of the action the agent can perform. This is usually phrased in natural language for easy scanning—like _“Display all pending tasks”_.                                                                                       |
| **Type**          | The category of action based on intent: <br />• `Assist` – Uses KB content to answer or guide users <br />• `Navigation` – Opens a page or route <br />• `Create`, `Fetch`, `Update`, `Delete` – Standard CRUD actions linked to APIs |
| **Tools**         | The underlying components (APIs, KB pages, or app routes) that power the action. Actions often pull from multiple tools to execute a complete flow.                                                                                   |
| **Topics**        | High-level product areas or workflows—like _“Spend Management”_ or _“Access Management.”_ These are automatically derived from your Knowledge Base and help categorize where each action belongs.                                     |
| **Last Modified** | The most recent date the action was edited or updated. Helpful for version tracking.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Status**        | A toggle to **Publish** or **Un-publish** an action. Only published actions are available to the end users to use. Keep them unpublished until fully reviewed.                                                                        |

### How Actions Come Together

To recap:

- **APIs** define what can be done
- **Entities** help fill in the right data
- **Pages** define where to go
- **KB content** supports guidance and context

All of that comes together into **Actions**—the building blocks of your agent’s capabilities.
