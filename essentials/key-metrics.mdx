- **Interactions:** Total number of questions, commands, or actions users send to the Copilot.
- **Active Users:** Count of unique users engaging with the Copilot over a given period.

## 2. Resolution & Success Metrics

- **Resolution Rate:** Percentage of user queries successfully resolved by the Copilot without human intervention.
- **Escalation Rate:** Percentage of interactions that require handoff to a human or another system.
- **Feedback Score:** Average user rating or thumbs-up/down on Copilot responses.

## 3. Efficiency Metrics

- **Time to Resolution:** Average time taken for the Copilot to resolve a user’s request.
- **Deflection Rate:** Percentage of queries handled by the Copilot that would otherwise have gone to support or another team.
