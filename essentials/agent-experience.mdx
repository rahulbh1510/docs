**Agent Experience** is the end-user interface where your customers interact with the agents you’ve built in the Agent Builder. 

It’s the Copilot layer that sits on top of your product—designed to unify agent capabilities into one intuitive, natural-language-driven experience.

This is what your users will see and use. It’s where they can ask questions, trigger actions, automate workflows, and get real outcomes—all without needing to navigate complex menus or learn your product’s UI.

### Deployment Options

You can deploy the Agent Experience in one of three flexible formats:

1. **As a Copilot Sidebar**

   A collapsible assistant that lives persistently across your app, available wherever users need help or want to take action.
2. **As a Unified Search Experience**

   A search-first interface that lets users ask questions, run actions, and surface relevant information across your product—all in one place.
3. **As the Primary Homepage of Your Product**

   Turn your product's landing view into a fully agent-driven interface, where the agent becomes the first step in every user journey.
