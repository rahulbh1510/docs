Now that the 24-hour discovery period is complete, you'll get access to the Agent Builder Platform. You can read more about what the Agent Builder is here.

## Video Walkthrough

You can view a complete walkthrough of the Tools tab in the video below, or keep reading for a detailed breakdown.

## Notes

This is the first screen you’ll see when you login and it highlights all the tools and actions that have been auto-generated for you to explore.

Let's start by exploring the **Tools section**, which is organized into 5 key tabs:

1. **APIs** - The app's API endpoints that we've discovered and cataloged
2. **Content** - Individual pages from your app's Knowledge Base
3. **Entities** - Business logic objects that highlight key data structures and resolution methods
4. **Pages** - Specific URLs and routes within your application
5. **FAQs** - Frequently asked questions we've extracted from your Knowledge Base

Each of these components works together to power the Actions your users will perform through natural language commands.

Let’s do a quick deep dive into two key tools - API’s and Entities.

### The APIs Tab

The APIs tab gives you a clear view of all the endpoints we found—basically every action your users can take in your app, traced back to its underlying API call. It's all organized in one place for easy browsing.

**Click any row to see the details →**

Each API has been made LLM ready - with a clear title, description, and sample prompts that help the language models understand what each endpoint does and when to use it.

You can also view the sample headers, payload structures, and response outputs for any specific endpoint here.

### The Entities Tab

Entities are the structured objects your application revolves around—think users, tasks, campaigns, tickets, and so on. They represent the core data models your APIs act upon.

Adopt auto-discovers Entities from two key sources:

- **Your API specification** – to extract parameters, schema definitions, and object relationships.
- **Your Knowledge Base** – to enrich Entities with context, terminology, and usage examples.

Each Entity is defined with a name, type (object, enum, etc.), and sample values. This makes them both human-readable and model-friendly.

### **Why Entities matter →**

Entities play a critical role in helping the agent reason about your application’s data and execute API calls with precision.

They:

- Make API calls _accurate_ by supplying structured values like IDs, names, or enum options.
- Help interpret user intent (“Update John’s task” → Who’s John? What task?).
- Ground the prompts so the LLM knows what’s possible and what’s not.

**A quick example →**

Let’s say your app has a `Campaign` object. We’ll create a `Campaign` Entity with properties like:

- `campaign_name`
- `campaign_id`
- `status` (active, paused, draft)

Now when a user says, “Pause the summer campaign,” your agent will:

1. Look up known Campaigns
2. Match “summer campaign” to the right one
3. Trigger the correct API call with the appropriate ID and status
