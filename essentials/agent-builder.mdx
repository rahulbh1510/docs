At Adopt, we offer two core products that work together to bring your app's AI agents to life.

- **Agent Builder** – for your product and engineering teams to build, design, manage and deploy the agent behind the scenes.
- **Agent Experience** – the end-user interface that lets your customers interact with your app using natural language.

Let’s start with how Agent Builder powers it all.

**Agent Builder** is the core platform that your product and engineering teams will use to design, develop, deploy, and manage AI Agents inside your application.

It’s built for internal use by product and engineering teams—your end users will never see it.

The platform gives you full control over the agent lifecycle—from setup and action creation to testing, deployment, and debugging. It’s designed to simplify the process, so you can move fast without getting blocked by complex workflows or heavy engineering lift.

## What You Can Do with Agent Builder

Agent Builder supports the full agent development workflow, covering the following key use cases:
